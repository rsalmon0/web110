			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze2WPWH_WZU" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">A Real Human Bean</a>  Released August 10th 2016 -  A Real Human Bean was my first real attempt at anything in the 
			Hotline Miami 2 editor. 
			It was not intended to be anything serious<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 
			just me trying to get the grips with the editor and cutscene creator. It gained popularity when I put it out<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> but then when the game’s developers <a href="https://youtu.be/6Gw6iuUWBKc" target="_blank">streamed
			Human Bean</a> during a charity event it skyrocketed to one of the most well known levels in the community.</p>

			<p>H.M. Hammarin is a real life friend of the developers<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> and was placed as a character in the game’s editor<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> with the intended purpose of letting map makers come up with their own story for him<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 
			which is exactly what I did (and probably why they chose the level to stream). </p>

			<p>The name ‘A Real Human Bean’ is derived from the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8" target="_blank">‘A  Real Human Being’</a> from the film Drive<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> the main inspiration for the Hotline Miami games.</p><hr>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVBVfpy4eE" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">9 Lives</a>  September 3rd 2016 - Community member JrekMeccia reskinned an entire
			character sprite sheet into a cat<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> and released it to the web. Wanting to be the first to capitalize on this hilarious reskin<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span>
			I made 9 lives in a weekend<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 3 levels about the cat’s adventures. Despite being a very fast and lower quality thing I slapped together<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 
			it’s the most popular thing I’ve ever released and sits at #3 most popular of all time<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> embodying <a href="images/finished/ohno.png" target="_blank">this </a>image...</p> <br>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPbW41SJ7T4" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">Rooster Files</a>  Sepr 23 2016 - My first attempt at a ‘serious’ storyline<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span>
			Rooster Files follows the detective Manny Pardo
			as he tries to hunt down a Serial Killer. The basic loop is simple<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> play as the killer 
			and then investigate the crime scene as the detective. This was my first real foray into creating custom assets for projects and utilizing NotePad++ to alter levels the tools in the editor did not allow.</p><br><br>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EDqkvx61hw" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">A Real Human Bean 2</a>   December 22 2016 - Because of its popularity<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span>
			and the freedom of ideas such a silly premise afforded me<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> Human Bean 2 was made. The story follows Hammarin’s fall from grace as his criminal 
			empire he established in the first installments collapses. I tried to humanize Hammarin here to make him a more likeable character<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> and show the consequences of his actions.
			But mostly it’s a collection of silly setpieces and impressive-for-2016 ideas I had learned how to pull off while working on other projects. 
			To date it remains the only collection of levels to ever feature a drivable vehicle sequence (though incredibly janky). </p>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwgqlDwV3Go" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">Madness</a>  January 21 2017 - After Human Bean 2 released<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span>
			I spent the remainder of my Christmas break finishing up a collaboration project that had been started by TheBlueDoctor. He had gotten various community 
			members to contribute levels and sprites assets to his project<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> but after scrapping the original narrative<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 
			I came in to save the project and restructure the pieces we had into a new storyline<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> creating an additional level as well as all the cutscenes. </p><br><br>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx1eX5tTkBM" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">Berlin Blitz</a>  March 24 2017 - By now I had become quite familiar with creating my own custom assets
			and wanted to push that ability to the next level. Berlin Blitz is a ‘total conversion mod’ that changes the 
			neon soaked 1980s era environments of Hotline Miami 2 into the war torn streets of Berlin. Across two levels<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> you play as a time traveling man cutting down Nazis on his way to kill Adolph Hitler. My custom assets 
			have aged like milk<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> looking back<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> but it was a great and ambitious attempt at the time to show what could be done in this editor. </p>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gImSBLs22TU" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">Don't Fear the Reefer</a>  August 27<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 2017 - Human Bean 3 had started development by now<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> but this was a side
			project of an idea I’d had in my brain for a while.
			It’s a single level set in the 1930s<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> with a black and white filter over everything but story important items<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> bullets<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> and blood. Ofcourse it was visually inspired by Sin City.
			Without being able to alter any code<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> each asset had to be desaturated and put back into the game manually. 
			One day I want to expand on this idea<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> and make my own game around it. But for now it will sit as a single level with no conclusion.</p>

			<p><a href="https://youtu.be/-hcBWeFzqek" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">Dark Wright</a>  July 28<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 2018 - Friends from the community<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> Richard (from the UK) and Technobreaker (from Turkey) approached
			me about the idea to use the game’s non-lethal melee character 
			(Evan Write) for a batman parody dubbed The Dark Write. It features a batsuit clad Evan on an adventure to find the dreaded Miami Mutilator serial killer. 
			It farted around in Development hell for about a year before I took it upon myself to fully get done the summer of 2018. Multiple members of the community contributed level and the script was written by the 
			best comedy writer in the community - Puzzlebox (from Finland). I think the script is the funniest thing in the workshop personally. </p>

			<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SMzppA_YCE" class="finishedLinks" target="_blank">Editor Tutorials</a> The summer of 2017 my friend Matt Foley and I decided to make a tutorial series of 
			everything to know about the editor. 
			As two popular creators in the community we were often inundated with the same basic questions<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> and decided it would be best to create a video tutorial series to send people to. 
			It was a success with rejuvenating the community and making the editor (which prior to our guides you had to learn via trial and error and help from message boards) much more accessible. </p>
