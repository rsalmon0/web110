			<p class="opening" id="about">Underneath the usual bustle and violence of Miami<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> a far worse threat lurks... </p> 
			
			<p>A shroud of chilling despair cloaks the night's<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> and the days are filled with an unseen tension. The whole world is gripped in the clutches of barely repressed
			primal fear.
			A cult gathers round a grotesque idol<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> coldly repeating chants foreign to the human tongue.</p>

			<p>Who will stop their horrific summons?</p> 
			<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheMiamiHorror" target="blank_">The Miami Horror</a> is a stand-alone mod of Hotline Miami.  Unlike the 2nd game<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> the first Hotline Miami had its source code fully released for the public to alter 
			in the Gamemaker Engine. 
			This project is run and primarily developed by my friend Danny Judas. I am on the team along with six others. I am designing levels for the project<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 
			and have worked closely with the team for 2+ years now to decide important game design choices and ideas. This mod is heavily altered from the original source code<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> 
			with the goal of making it feel as fluid and fast paced as the 2nd Hotline Miami game.
			As a level designer our main focus is to make atmospheric levels that carry a very deliberate difficulty curve to teach players how to play the game.</p>

				young man who has fallen in with the wrong crowd. 
				Andy's levels are non-lethal stealth focused<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> where players will have to skulk through the darkness to get around enemies to accomplish his goals.  </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
				
				<figure class="rightfloat"><img alt="The Crusader" src="images/crusader.png" height="300"></figure><p><span style="color:#EC790F; text-shadow: 2px 2px #232323">The Crusader</span> is a mysterious
				man hunting down the cult<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span>
				striking their hideouts and trying to dismantle their operation piece by piece. Crusader comes down from a long lineage of warriors fighting darkness since before recorded history.
				In the modern age<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> his tools of the trade are:</p>
				
				<figure><img alt="Toz" src="images/toz.png" height="15"></figure>
				<p>The <span style="color:#EC790F; text-shadow: 2px 2px #232323">TOZ Over-Under Shotgun</span> capable of sweeping an entire room with two powerful blasts.</p>
				
                <figure><img alt="M16c" src="images/m16c.png" height="30"></figure>
				<p>The <span style="color:#EC790F; text-shadow: 2px 2px #232323">m16c assault rifle</span> 
				High capacity and comes with an under barrel grenade launcher to blow apart walls<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> doors<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> or man.</p>
				
                <figure><img alt="Crossbow" src="images/crossbow.png" height="30"></figure>
				<p>And the <span style="color:#EC790F; text-shadow: 2px 2px #232323">Compound Crossbow</span>
				to silently eliminate enemies at range<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> by lining your shot up with the laser sight. </p>

				<figure><img alt="Journalist" src="images/journo.png" height="300"></figure><p><span style="color:#EC790F; text-shadow: 2px 2px #232323">Journalist</span>
				is investigating the cult as its activities in Miami pick up. She claims she is just looking for answers<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span>
				but there may be more to her than it seems.</p>
				<p>Journalist is an expert with a knife and can combat roll to knock down her foes and dodge their attacks. She can also unload the ammunition out of firearms to keep them out of enemy hands and 
				extend her combo meter.</p><br>

                </iframe></figure><p>A huge upside of being able to alter a game's source code is that we can now add improvements and additions to the game's mechanics. To encourage players to play fast and aggressively<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span>
				we have added in two massive changes.
				The first is an Anti-Bait script that prevents Ai from being easily manipulated and killed by baiting them into chokepoints. Now when players try this<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> enemies will back off and shoot faster at a player. </p>
				
				<figure class="rightfloat"><iframe width="320" height="240" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJDreUrSmp4">
                </iframe></figure><p> The other is boosts for gaining combos. Every 5x gained in a combo will reward the player with additional health<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> ammo<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> or other bonuses. New ways of refreshing your combo will help you
				keep from dropping it! As The Crusader<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> reloading will freeze the combo<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> and picking up ammo refreshes it entirely. While as Journalist you can refresh the combo by disarming enemy weapons. This will help greatly
				carry your combos from floor to floor.
				</p><br>
				
				<figure><img alt="Boar" src="images/boar.png" height="300"></figure><p>New Enemy types can also be added<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> such as the Boar. He wears a Kevlar vest over his cult robes<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> which makes him immune to bullets. Enough shots will knock him over<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span> but if not dealt with quickly<span style="font-family:'Nanum Gothic'">,</span>
				he will rise back up drawing a sidearm!
